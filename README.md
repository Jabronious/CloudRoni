# CloudRoni Rules
<h3>GOAL</h3>
    <p>
        The objective of this competition is to boost moral and create camaraderie. The other primary goal is to increase usership of your particular products and provide a means to get problematic clients to a level of self-sufficiency while increasing every day usage.
    </p>
    <h3>The Draft</h3>
    <p>
        Before the draft being the owner of the league will be required to upload a csv file of player that will be selected from and the necessary requirements for 
        said csv are provided at the upload page.
    </p>
    <h5>DRAFT RULES</h5>
    <p>
        The season will begin with a draft. The draft order will be determined by either randomized. During the draft there is will be a 3 minute long timer that the person currently set to pick will have to choose their client.
    </p>
    <h3>Trades</h3>
    <p>
        The option to trade players will be given to the teams and will exist in three states; Pending, Declined, and Accepted. Each team will be able to see all trades 
        that they are apart of their "Trades" tab.
    </p>
    <h3>Points</h3>
    <p>
        The point system could sometimes rely on an honor code system. In this event, if ever discovered that the team was caught not marking points they will immediately be given 10 points per discovered incident. 
        Also, in other cases it will be on the individual trainer who handled the client to mark points on the other team’s score. 
        Calls/Support Emails must be customer service related, if it is questionable, then trainers will vote and majority wins. 
        In the case of a tie, one trainer from opposing sides will play a sudden death game of Jenga (or your board game of choice).

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
        Usage should be determined based on actionable events that they perform on the given product. For example, if your particular product includes making phone calls
        then when a call is placed this would be one actionable event. Automatically triggered events should not count.
